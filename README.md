# emma-lightbox

This plugin adds lightbox functionality to the Gutenberg in WordPress.

To use, perform the following steps:
* clone this repo into `wp-content/plugins/`
* activate plugin in WordPress
* Add the class `lightgallery` to any image block, or container of image block(s) (note: if you apply the class to a container of images, the lightbox will include left/right controls to page through all images within that container)
* Make sure any image block the `lightgallery` class is applied to is hyperlinked to that image's own source.
